<p>This test demonstrates the use of aria role="heading" and the aria-level property to mark elements not styled as headings as headings including their hierarchical structure.  Each heading's text is followed by a number in parenthesis. This number corresponds to the heading level the screen reader should report the heading as. A screen reader user should be able to identify that text is a heading, identify the correct heading level, and be able to use screen reader navigation keys to move to these headings.
